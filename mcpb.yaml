feature_or_area: "GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline Architecture"

motivation: "The current GitHub Actions setup suffers from critical maintainability issues with massive code duplication (Node.js setup appears 15+ times across workflows), severe documentation gaps (CLAUDE.md lists 4 workflows but 13 exist), and inconsistent configuration management. This technical debt creates maintenance overhead, increases risk of configuration drift, and makes it difficult to implement consistent changes across the CI/CD pipeline. The lack of reusable components violates DRY principles and leads to manual synchronization errors when updating common functionality."

current_state: "13 individual GitHub Actions workflows with extensive duplication of setup steps, inconsistent Hugo version specifications (0.128.0, 0.140.0, 0.148.1, 0.148.2, 'latest'), varying artifact retention policies (1-14 days), and no reusable workflow components. Custom actions include unnecessary wrappers (3-line setup-node, 55-line install-deps for npm ci). E2E testing workflows share 90% identical setup steps but are implemented separately. Documentation is severely outdated, listing only 4 workflows when 13 exist, creating maintenance blind spots."

proposal: "Implement a comprehensive refactoring using reusable GitHub Actions workflows and standardized configuration. Create shared workflow components (_shared-setup.yml, _hugo-test.yml, _security-scan.yml, _e2e-base.yml) that eliminate duplication while preserving all functionality. Consolidate redundant workflows (build.yml + hugo-build.yml), standardize configuration across all workflows, remove unnecessary custom action wrappers, and update documentation to accurately reflect the architecture. Execute through 7 phases: foundation/assessment, reusable components creation, critical workflow migration, non-critical migration, cleanup/documentation, testing/validation, and deployment/handover."

benefits:
  - "60-70% reduction in duplicated workflow code, significantly improving maintainability"
  - "Standardized configuration management eliminates inconsistencies and reduces configuration drift"
  - "Faster development cycles through reusable components that can be updated centrally"
  - "Reduced risk of CI/CD failures due to consistent, well-tested shared workflows"
  - "Accurate documentation that matches implementation reality, improving team productivity"
  - "Lower maintenance overhead for adding new workflows or updating existing functionality"
  - "Improved reliability through centralized error handling and retry logic"

risks_or_alternatives: "Primary risk is potential CI/CD disruption during migration, mitigated by incremental phase-based approach with comprehensive testing and rollback capabilities. Alternative approaches include big-bang replacement (higher risk) or maintaining status quo (continuing technical debt accumulation). The planned incremental migration with backup/rollback strategy minimizes risks while maximizing benefits."

estimated_effort: "Medium complexity, approximately 3-4 engineering weeks spread across 7 phases. Majority of effort in phases 2-3 (reusable components creation and critical workflow migration). Testing and validation phase critical for ensuring zero-downtime deployment."

open_questions:
  - "Should we implement workflow-level configuration validation to prevent future configuration drift?"
  - "What monitoring and alerting should be added to track the health of refactored workflows?"
  - "How should we handle the transition period where some workflows use new architecture and others use legacy structure?"
  - "Should we establish governance processes to prevent future duplication as new workflows are added?"
